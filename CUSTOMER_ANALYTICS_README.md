## 🔑 Key Improvements

### The "New Customers" Bug (FIXED ✅)

**Before (BROKEN ❌):**
```
Profile created: Jan 1
First booking: Feb 15
Result: NOT counted as "new" on Feb 15 ❌
```

**After (CORRECT ✅):**
```
first_booking_at = Feb 15 (actual first booking)
Result: Correctly counted as "new" on Feb 15 ✅
Impact: Accurate KPIs for growth tracking!
```

### Architecture Benefit

```
BEFORE:
  Dashboard → Query bookings + square_existing_clients + payments
             (slow, error-prone, inconsistent)

AFTER:
  Dashboard → Query customer_analytics
             (fast, consistent, accurate)
             ↑ Single source of truth
             ↑ Precomputed metrics
             ↑ No data quality issues
```
